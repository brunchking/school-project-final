        <p class="card-text">
            Daikichi Imura, the magistrate of Taipei Prefecture under Japanese Colonial Government, built the Beitou
            Public Bathhouse in June 1913, which was the largest bathhouse in East Asia at that time. The design of the
            bathhouse was based on the Mount Izu Hot Spring Bathhouse in Japan. After World War II, the Beitou Public
            Bathhouse was abandoned due to constantly changing institutions in charge.

            In 1994, a group of teachers and students from Beitou Elementary School discovered the deserted bathhouse on
            a field trip of local culture course, and petitioned for the conservation of it. The Beitou Public Bathhouse
            was finally declared Municipal Monument on February 20, 1997. After certain restorations, the Beitou Hot
            Spring Museum was open to Public on October 31, 1998.

            As the very first building to be salvaged by the community and converted into a museum, the Hot Spring
            Museum has become a symbol of Beitou culture, also serving as the core of hot spring culture in Beitou. It
            is often viewed as the cluster of the rich Beitou local culture and resources. <br>
