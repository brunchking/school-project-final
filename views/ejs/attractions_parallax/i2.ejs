        <p class="introduce">
            Qijin is a long slender island known as Qihou in earlier times. The Lilliputian island has numerous visitor
            attractions and is today accessible by both ferry and car. Tianhou Temple on Miaoqian Road is a historic
            site dating back 300 years. There are also rickshaws with drivers decked out in Tang dynasty attire. Qijin
            Old Street is lined with restaurants selling fresh and budget-friendly seafood alfresco style.
            The island offers great views of Kaohsiung City and of the cargo ships anchored and waiting to enter
            Kaohsiung Harbor. Chijin has a historic lighthouse, World War 1 bunkers, and an old artillary fortress. All
            are connected by a walking path that runs along the cliffs and harbor.

        <h3>Transportation:</h3>
        <p class="introduce">
            To get to Qijin Island, most commuters and tourists take the ferry from the Gushan Ferry Pier (takes about
            five minutes and costs NT$40 one way). To get there from the Banana Pier, walk for about a kilometer west
            along the harbor following Jiexing 1st Street and then Binhai 1st Road (connected to each other by a narrow
            alley). On weekends, however, you can also take a ferry directly from the Banana Pier (departures every half
            hour; NT$40 one way; info about Kaohsiung ferry services: kcs.kcg.gov.tw). After arriving at Qijin Island,
            make sure to do the following: walk up to the Qihou Lighthouse and the Qihou Battery; check out the Tianhou
            Temple and Qijin Old Street; rent a bicycle or electric quadricycle and explore the island’s sea-facing side
            (part of which is Qijin Seaside Park). If time allows, take in one of the gorgeous sunsets Qijin is famous
            for while relaxing on the island’s dark-sand beach.
